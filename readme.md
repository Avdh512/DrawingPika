# üì∏ Professional Photo Blog üìù

**A full-stack photo blog application built with a Python Flask backend and a modern, responsive frontend.**



## ‚ú® App Features & Highlights ‚ú®

* **Photo Upload:** Easily upload new photos with a dedicated form for adding titles, dates, locations, and descriptions. Supports drag-and-drop and multiple file selection.
* **Image Management:** The server automatically generates unique filenames to prevent conflicts and stores photos in a dedicated `photos` directory.
* **RESTful API:** A Flask-based backend provides endpoints for uploading, retrieving, updating, and deleting photos and their metadata.
* **Dynamic Metadata:** Photo details like title, date, time, location, and description are stored in a `photo_metadata.json` file for persistence.
* **Physical Image Rotation:** Photos can be rotated directly from the frontend, with the changes being applied physically to the image file on the server. The application also handles EXIF orientation data.
* **Multiple Views:**
  * **Photo Blog:** Displays photos in a chronological blog format, complete with detailed descriptions.
  * **Gallery Grid:** A modern, responsive grid layout for browsing photos, with a full-screen modal viewer on click.
  * **Calendar View:** A calendar highlights days with photo uploads, allowing users to filter the gallery by date.
* **Data Management:** Users can view all photo metadata in a formatted JSON view and download it for backup purposes. A dedicated section for permanent deletion of photos and data is also included.
* **User-Friendly UI:** The frontend is a single-page application with a clean design, smooth transitions, and a dark mode toggle. The interface is built with the **Inter** font for a professional and legible appearance across all devices.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Avdh512/DrawingPika.git
   cd DrawingPika

   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended) or you can just use the exisiting one that i made:

   ```
   python -m venv venv

   ```

   * **On Windows:**
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate

     ```
   * **On macOS/Linux:**
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate

     ```
3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask server:**
   ```
   python server.py

   ```
2. **Access the application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

**The server will automatically create the necessary **`photos` and `public` directories, as well as an empty `photo_metadata.json` file if they don't already exist.
